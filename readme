A program to decode .wav files that contain morse code.

Use python3 main.py [path to wav file]

Bugs:

Doesn't properly space some words due to logic used to detect spaces.

TODO:

Seperate into classes.
Add englsh to written morse
Add written morse to englsh
Add english to morse in wav
Add written morse to wav
